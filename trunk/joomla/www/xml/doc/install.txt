=================================

BKEF XSLT file collection
---------------------------------
- bkef.xsd

XML Schema definitions of valid BKEF XML file

- bkef.xsl

XSLT template for producing single website (BKEF website) of meta-attributes and optionaly imports the bkef-matrix.xsl

- bkef-matrix.xsl

XSLT template for producing matrix of mutual influences among meta-attributes

Language definitions (currently implemented czech and english)

- influences.js

Partial displaying of the matrix (according to the meta-attributes of level 1)

- wz_tooltip.js

Tooltip for matrix

- style.css
CSS of the BKEF website and single matrix website

place this file to the css folder of the active template 
bkef.css -> templates/rhuk_milkyway/css
and link it to the template 
 see install_instructions_editTemplate.JPG

---------------------------------

This documentation describes BKEF* and BKEF-Matrix* XSLT templates which produce single Web-page (valid XHTML) showing the content of the valid BKEF XML file.
Note: with the "*" is meant the XSLT template (the file) for better orientation in the following text.

These templates produces XHTML Web-page showing the content of the valid BKEF XML file.

(1) BKEF* (bkef.xsl)

The BKEF* template produces an overview of meta-attributes from BKEF XML source file.

Important parts of the template:
    [a] Navigation
    [b] 1. Group of meta-attributes (level 1)
        |   - 1. Meta-attribute (level 0)
        |     | - Important premises
        |     | - Format
        |     |
        |     |
        |   - m. Meta-attribute (level 0)
        |  
        |  
        n. Group of meta-attributes
    [c] Data Matrix
    
[a] Makes the navigation window for easier browsing of produced XHTML website. See the APPENDIX.
[b] Shows the clear list of meta-attributes with their parametres
[c] Data Matrix - optional part, which is produced (imported) by single file BKEF-Matrix*

Important parameters and settings of BKEF*
------------------------------------------

Following parameters are defined on the beginning of the BKEF*.

[-] Name of the parametres

[csspath]
CSS Path - lokalization of CSS file (the name of the file is defined, so only the location of folder have to be specified)
Example: <xsl:param name="csspath" select="'com_bkef/css/'"/>
- the path must end with "/" (com_bkef/css/)

[jspath]
JS (JavaScript) Path: <xsl:param name="jspath" select="'com_bkef/js/'"/>
The lokation of folder in this example is "com_bkef/js/"

[img-url]
The location of folder img/ with images of mutual influences
Example: <xsl:param name="image-url" select="'xml/bkef/img/'" />

[dictpath]
The location of the dictionary.xml file with various language versions. The name dictionary.xml shall be mentioned.
Example: <xsl:param name="dictpath" select="'bkef/dict/dictionary.xml'" />

[lang]
Language - "cz" or "en"
<xsl:param name="lang">cz</xsl:param>

[contentOnly]
!! Very important !!
Settings for content:

If paremeter contentOnly contains the value 1, then it produces the content within <body>...</body> (so the website without any definitions).
If the contentOnly contains the value 0, then it produces complete website

Example (this definition produces complete website): <xsl:param name="contentOnly" select="0"/>

[Matrix]
If the value of parameter Matrix is 1, then it means true, so the Matrix will be included
The value 0 of parameter Matrix means the opposite, matrix will not be produced.

Example (matrix will be produced): <xsl:param name="Matrix" select="1"/>

(2) BKEF-Matrix* (bkef-matrix.xsl)

The BKEF-Matrix* produces single matrix of all meta-attributes.

Important parameters and settings of BKEF-Matrix*
-------------------------------------------------

Settings are analog to BKEF*.

[csspath] see the definition above
[jspath] see the definition above
[lang] see the definition above
[contentOnly] see the definitions above (in this case there will be produced
[img-url] see the definition above
[dictpath] see the definition above
[image-url] see the definition above


(.1) APPENDIX - Navigation Menu

The important feature of the navigation menu is the possibility to display (partial displaying) the matrix partially according to the meta-attributes of level 1.

Partial displaying does work only within complete website (contentOnly 0).


(.2) APPENDIX - INSTALATION AND DEFAULT SETTINGS FOR JOOMLA CMS (with installed SEWEBAR plugin for editing BKEF documents)

!! BKEF* and BKEF-Matrix* shall be saved together within the same directory.

BKEF*

[contentOnly]
<xsl:param name="contentOnly" select="1"/>

[Matrix]
<xsl:param name="Matrix" select="1"/>

[csspath]
<xsl:param name="jspath" select="'xml/bkef/css/'"/>

[jspath]
<xsl:param name="jspath" select="'xml/bkef/js/'"/>

[img-url]
<xsl:param name="image-url" select="'xml/bkef/img/'" />

[dictpath]
<xsl:param name="dictpath" select="'bkef/dict/dictionary.xml'" />

Important JS files for SEWEBAR:
- wz_tooltip.js shall be included within the (SEWEBAR) BKEF plugin in folder js/.
- influences.js shall be also included in the js/ folder (but the path to the file has to be provided externally - just when the parameter [contentOnly] has value 1 (true), then the definition of the path to influences.js is not defined by the bkef.xls.

BKEF-Matrix*

If the BKEF-Matrix* is not use alone, but is imported by BKEF*, then the same parameters are inherited from BKEF*.

[image-url]
<xsl:param name="image-url" select="'img/'"/>
It means the img/ folder shall be in the same directory as BKEF* as well as BKEF-Matrix*.

IMPORTANT REMARK TO THE PATHS

- BKEF* and BKEF-Matrix* shall be together in the same directory
- dictionary.xml shall be in the same directory as BKEF* as well as BKEF-Matrix*
- bkef.xsd is not directly used, it can serve as a control instance for creating new BKEF XML documents
