This folder contains PMML-based query. Queries are generated based on individual association rules from PMML. 
The query generation process has four phases. 
Phase 1: a single association rule is isolated from PMML (QueryByAssociationRule)
Phase 2: the query is interpreted into query language independent form
Phase 3: query is translated to a specific query language.
Phase 4: query is passed to the query engine returns xml-formatted results

Program: transformPMMLARtoARQuery*.xsl
Input: valid against ARQuery0_1.xsd and QueryByAssociationRule0_1.sch
Output: valid against ARQuery0_1.xsd and ARQuery_tx_0_1.sch, where x is the type of query
